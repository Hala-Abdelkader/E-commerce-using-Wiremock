## Introduction
The objective of this project was to create a mock server using WireMock to 
simulate multiple endpoints across various services. The services involved are User, 
Product, Order, and Payment services. This setup allows for testing and 
development without the need for actual backend implementations, providing a 
controlled environment to test client applications.
